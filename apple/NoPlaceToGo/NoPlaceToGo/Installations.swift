                Liberace loved all the finest things in life, diamonds, mansions, small dogs, and beautiful men. However, in the afterlife, he’s moved from the glitz and glamour of a Las Vegas hotel to a gritty former Dollar Tree Store in Lakewood, Colorado. Some of the glitter of Vegas has rubbed off as he performs the same four-minute act again and again for all eternity.

                Artists: Grace Cooper & Chrissy Espinoza

                This installation piece is a collaboration between Grace Cooper and Chrissy Espinoza consisting of a bedroom scene combining video, sculptural, and performance elements. We hope to exhibit the emotions and the internal struggle happening within the stillness of an ordinary bedroom.
                
                With this project we’ll delve into our shared experiences with sleep paralysis and demonstrate our visual representation of it playing out in accordance to our comparative experiences and the accounts of many others. We will be exploring concepts of subjugation, estrangement and fear that can be experienced even within the safety of a seemingly peaceful and familiar environment. We will be focusing on the supernatural effects from sleep paralysis. An alarming number of sufferers observe a similar dark or demonic entity that suppresses one’s ability to breath by perching upon their chest or pinning them down. The video projection will be shot and directed by Chrissy Espinoza and feature Grace Cooper performing “the spirit” or the conscious attempting to escape the body (the bedridden sculpture). Grace will also appear in a projection over the body in the form of the classical sleep paralysis demon. Inspired by the iconic incubus from Henry Fuseli’s 1781 oil painting “The Nightmare.”

                The feeling of being trapped is terrible. Feeling helpless is terrible. We hope our piece will speak to any persons that have ever felt those feelings even if they have not themselves suffered from sleep paralysis. We hope it will speak to anyone who has ever been restricted to the isolation of hiding their true selves or concealed themselves sensing a potentially hostile atmosphere. To anyone that has been stranded in a time and place that in one reality seems familiar and innocuous, yet in another is oppressive and dangerous. To anyone that’s felt trapped in their own body. To anyone who’s felt watched, spied on or viewed as a curiosity.

                The Intervening Substance is inspired by ectoplasm, and the early mediums who produced it.  Scientists captured mesmerizing photos of what looks like a cloth substance oozing from mediums’ bodies.  One researcher explains  “The color white is the most frequent.... it can seem soft and a bit elastic when it spreads;.... it gives the sensation of a spider’s web fluttering over the observers’ hand...The substance is mobile. At one moment it evolves slowly, rises, falls, wanders over the medium…”  Mediums had power because they delivered messages from beyond.  Humans strive for guidance, and acceptance from mysterious external forces.  We not only pursue messages from the dead but also solicit advice from Artificial Intelligence, fortune tellers, technology, aliens, Gods, and even celebrities or social media.  What do we give up when we focus our search for meaning and acceptance on distant external forces.  This work is a response to the human search for explanations to our existence, and our desire to be accepted. It is not meant to condemn our search for meaning, but to question our process while creating a complex feeling of simultaneous joy and discomfort within the viewer.

                One of the most devastating lies humanity tells is that love, passion, desire, and all of their distant relatives live in the heart. What catastrophic knowledge must these inhabitants contain to warrant a linguistic feigned expulsion from the garden of the brain into the wilderness of the body? What cold, wretched being would need to believe in a wall between the two?
                 
                In some gardens, anomalies are named weeds and believed to be discarded, invaders from bodily lands yet to be conquered. But the wild of the wilderness brain survives between the rows and boxes, a ghost haunting the ether of unseen spaces, flourishing. When their roots erode the garden walls, when all of the gates are opened, the gardeners with the most walls flailingly insist humanity must live in the heart, in the other body. Everything here is named and in boxes. It is paradise. The wilderness, already in its home, does not listen.

                Design, Production & Fabrication: Hayley Dixon & Renee Marino
                Sound Design: Justin Forthuber

                The Waiting Room seeks to explore the anxieties that occur within the liminal space of waiting rooms. Intrinsically, waiting rooms are the modern limbo; time and actions are dictated by someone else, and the passage through is defined by one's ability to answer questions which minimize and homogenize identities.  Although often associated with medical facilities, the concept of waiting rooms can be even more expansive-- a place where one simply waits. Waiting rooms are a space of expectation and “correct” answers, but how do these spaces feel to those who exist outside of standardized narratives? This installation explores the anxiety and fear of existing outside of the norm and furthermore, becoming disconnected from personal agency. The room appeals to a vaporwave aesthetic, drawing on early 2000’s digital art and a mash-up of obsolete and semi-obsolete technologies. Building on dystopian concepts of the past, the room reveals an enduring progression of sterile technologies that create dissonance between the space and the viewer.

                What would you give up in order to be part of a new world? This multi-medium hybrid performance/ installation peers behind the curtain of a posthuman liturgy at the parts and wires of a crumbling façade. We explore a relationship of dependence and exploitation as the technologically blurred boundaries of the machine and the organic manifest a chaotic cyborg reality. As we relinquish our data into the vectors of consumerism, our differences, our queerness, and our struggles for resistance find no way to escape from the digital nation-state. Situated in this violence of assimilation, capitalism, and consumer culture, we examine our relationship with excess and disconnection from the earth and each other. In this manifestation of the myth of the American Dream, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, only glitching circuits, bodies alienated from themselves. What would you sacrifice in order to avoid being the thing sacrificed?

                Sometimes when you are doing your absolute best to be a good sport and put on a smile, life can just be hard. Like a kick to the genitals, you are painfully frustrated.  Your heart murmurs in anticipation.  Small repetitive heart attacks only dissipate when distracted.  Sometimes no matter what you do you just get knocked down on your face. Until finally, the smallest thing like a grease stain on your shirt or smashing your finger is what breaks you. Like a cheap firework, you explode. Ashamed at how pathetic you are, you cry.
                
                As you grow older you learn that feeling never really goes away. It just pops up here and there over the years. Ultimately there is just No Place To Go. You will continue to be haunted by the never-ending overwhelm that is existing.

                Artist: Hayley Krichels

                In my work I am exploring the fear of being, of being watched/constantly having to perform and how it interacts with the same desire to perform and be seen. These fears are paramount to the queer identity; there are common, accepted ideas of what we are and how we exist in the world. We are expected to constantly represent these ideas in the public view. I am addressing these ideas by pairing the classic photo booth with the disconcerting voice of the observer, and an inability to control when and how you are being viewed.
