# No Place to Go (NP2G)

[No Place to Go](https://www.no-place-to-go.com) was a socially distanced haunted house running in October 2020. I was commisioned to develop the iOS app to coordinate the motion of single-car groups rotating through five sites and incorporate installation-specific content. I worked with the project directors and all 15 artists (and artist groups) to realize their visions of a unique immersive experience.

This was my first paid iOS development project; I thoroughly enjoyed it then and I fondly remember it now. I have been enjoying app development for years at this point but what I uniquely remember about this project while thinking "I am so glad that this is my job" was calling all of the artists and, despite initial hesitation and maybe nervousness from most of the artists, I relished in getting them to quickly warming up to 'the tech person' and brainstorming on what could be possible in the context of the app suporting the experience that they were creating. Sure, some artists had little to ask of me, while I was thrilled to work closely with the artists that saw the app doing something special for their creation.

Target iOS 13.6

> We’d downloaded the NP2G **app**-designed by Bryan Costanza ahead of the event. An organizer walked up to the driver-seat window and gave us a secret code to enter into the **app**, which gave us directions to each stop on the route: five abandoned storefronts, shops and window displays through which we could watch performances safely through a barrier, all within a two-mile area within Wheat Ridge and the 40 West Arts District.

>The **app** also played narration voiced by James Brunt, whose voice guided us through the “no place,” weaving together the artists’ disjointed ideas and fears into a cohesive — if absurdist — narrative. A spooky score by Mike Clark provided the soundtrack to our journey as we drove from installation to installation, and at each stop, the **app** offered contactless, choice-based interactions with the installations. -- [Denverite](https://denverite.com/2020/10/20/no-zombies-or-jump-scares-this-artist-designed-haunted-house-gives-you-a-safe-way-to-process-day-to-day-fears/)

> The No Place to Go **App** designed by Bryan Costanza provides each car with a unique show route as well as a sound score designed by Mike Clark to accompany the audience as they drive between sites. The **App** also provides additional show information and custom-made interactions with the installations to create a contactless experience. -- [NP2G Press Release](https://www.no-place-to-go.com/2020/09/18/press-release-no-place-to-go-in-fearful-times/)
